# Tilt Game

Tilt is a puzzle game where players move sliders on a square grid by tilting the board in one of four directions. Sliders slide until they hit an obstacle, another slider, or the board's edge. The goal is to maneuver a slider to a designated target square using the fewest moves possible.
